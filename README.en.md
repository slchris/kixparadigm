# kixparadigm

> **Minimal self-orchestration paradigm (resident cognition) × multi-agent orchestration × coding agent presets** — the full kix stack in one repo: one-command import into DeepSeek Harness, scripted import into VS Code Copilot.

> This document practices the repo's own paradigm: **resident minimum, progressive disclosure, no dual-sourced volatile numbers** — version history lives in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), mechanism mapping in [dsh/preset-classic/DSH-ADAPTATION.md](dsh/preset-classic/DSH-ADAPTATION.md) (not deployed at the default preset root); details are not duplicated here.

## Why

The kix paradigm began as a VS Code Copilot customization pack. Studying DeepSeek Harness (DSH) revealed a **natural mechanism fit**: resident cognition = preset persona, guard hooks = `tools/pre-execute` plugins, team agents = subagent dispatch, slash commands = native DSH commands, vision top-up = vision-bridge. Full mapping: [DSH-ADAPTATION.md](dsh/preset-classic/DSH-ADAPTATION.md) and [DSH-FUSION-MATRIX.md](dsh/preset-classic/DSH-FUSION-MATRIX.md).

The fit turns the paradigm from "one person's local Copilot customization" into "a reproducible public asset installable in one command" — that is why this repo is open source.

## Quick start (DSH, recommended)

```bash
npm i -g kixparadigm     # installs both default kixparadigm and classic kixparadigm-classic + vision-bridge; restart dsh web and pick a mode
npx kixparadigm install  # no global install
npm i -g kixparadigm-en  # English classic mode kixparadigm-classic-en (separate package)
```

> From v1.3.4 `npm i -g kixparadigm` installs both variants under `~/.dsh/.agent-presets/`. The ablation control `kixparadigm-null` is not installed by npm.
>
> **Pick the mode first.** Default `kixparadigm` is the incentive surface (compressed thinking anchors + utility criteria + on-demand skills; no ritual pipeline, no agents tree). `kixparadigm-classic` ships the full orchestration write-up (full anchors + kixpower manuals + agents/instructions). Use classic for complex collaboration / studying the paradigm; default no longer strips the core philosophy. The selector is task attributes, not "half-cost = no brain".

Custom DSH dir (`DSH_HOME`), `--preset-only`, ops commands (`doctor` / `uninstall` / `copilot`): see [dsh/README-DSH.md](dsh/README-DSH.md).

## Quick start (VS Code Copilot)

```bash
# Windows
.\install.ps1
# macOS / Linux
chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
```

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md). Start with `/kixpower-new`.

## What this is: two layers + plugin floor

The table is the paradigm's capability surface. **The default incentive preset injects compressed thinking anchors + utility criteria**; orchestration manuals and agent templates live in `kixparadigm-classic`. The skills shelf is on-demand in both.

| Layer | Component | One-liner |
|-------|-----------|-----------|
| **Cognition** (how to think) | default: compressed anchors + incentive; classic: full text | Three-channel cross-validation, phase duality, rules-are-debt, requirement triple-check (no user-pleasing), pre-code decision chain |
| **Execution** (how to execute) | kixpower (manuals with classic; member tiers activatable in both) | Orchestration model: lead model freely picks members (dev/qa/reviewer) + Sprint flow, DAG topology, 4-layer loop, four invariant floors |
| Mechanical guards | `kix-guards` · `kix-consistency` | Commit budget, feature branch, force push, dangerous SQL, control-plane protection (hard deny only for irreversible damage); preset consistency write-time guard (prevents zh/en drift) |
| Handoff discipline | `kix-orchestration` · `kix-discipline` | Subagent handoff evidence-chain checks; spec contract gate + verification gate |
| Focus | `kix-focus` | Tool surface 85→18 resident cut + on-demand catalog & proxied execution — progressive disclosure at runtime |
| Browser | `kix-browser` (resident on the default incentive face; not mounted on classic) | Native `browser{action}` with 17 actions (open/snapshot/click/type/press/select/hover/navigate/wait/screenshot/upload/tabs/dialog) — direct playwright-core, CDP attach takes over your real browser (login state preserved), session persists across calls; replaces the MCP five-hop chain. Death clause: comment the row back to on-demand if real sessions use it <2 times in a month |
| Cost & routing | `kix-cost` · `kix-route` | Subagent thinking-effort normalization; sentinel model names → runtime-available routes |
| Top-up | `kix-commands` · `dsh-vision-bridge` · `kix-stalled` | `/kixpower-*` native commands; image descriptions only for confirmed text-only models, native images for multimodal models; stalled-Sprint detection (enabled on the default incentive face, candidate keep; classic yml still commented = opt-in) |

The default incentive preset includes compressed thinking anchors + utility criteria + on-demand skills + probe/settle/experience. Classic additionally ships full orchestration manuals, agent templates, and instructions. Directories are authoritative. Per-plugin mechanics and evolution: [DSH-ADAPTATION.md](dsh/preset-classic/DSH-ADAPTATION.md), [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).

## Repo layout

```
kixparadigm/
├── dsh/preset/        ← default incentive face: persona/plugins/skills pointer; adaptation docs and agents live in classic
├── en/                ← English edition (separate npm package kixparadigm-en, released in sync with CN)
├── skills/ agents/ prompts/ memories/ instructions/   ← VS Code Copilot distribution (7-skill subset)
├── bin/ scripts/      ← CLI and install/verify/consistency-guard scripts
└── install.ps1 / install.sh / INSTALL.md / CHANGELOG.md
```

> **Source-of-truth convention**: `dsh/preset/` is the source of truth; `~/.dsh/.agent-presets/kixparadigm/` is only an installed copy (maintain = edit preset, then run `node scripts/sync-dsh-preset.cjs -Force`); root `skills/` etc. are the Copilot distribution, deliberately different from the DSH edition — do not overwrite either way.

## Development & verification

```bash
npm test                                    # consistency guard + full plugin regression (counts self-reported by test output, not maintained in this doc)
node scripts/check-dsh-consistency.cjs      # persona budget/distribution mirrors/bilingual consistency guard
kixparadigm doctor                          # install self-check
```
